    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    # Step 1: Set up Miniconda
    - name: Set up Conda
      uses: conda-incubator/setup-miniconda@v2
      with:
        conda-version: "4.10.3"  # Use a compatible version of Conda
        environment-file: conda.yaml  # Use conda.yaml to create environment
        auto-activate-base: false  # Don't automatically activate the base environment

    # Step 2: Install dependencies from conda.yaml
    - name: Install dependencies with Conda
      run: |
        conda env create -f conda.yaml  # Create conda environment from conda.yaml
        conda activate disease-symptom-prediction-env  # Activate the created environment
        conda list  # Verify installed packages

    # Step 3: Run MLflow project
    - name: Run MLflow Project
      run: |
        conda activate disease-symptom-prediction-env  # Activate the environment
        mlflow run .  # Run the MLflow project

    # Step 4: (Optional) Run tests
    - name: Run tests (optional)
      run: |
        conda activate disease-symptom-prediction-env
        pytest tests  # If you have tests in a "tests" directory

    # Step 5: Archive results (optional)
    - name: Archive MLflow run results
      run: |
        mkdir -p mlflow-artifacts
        cp -r mlruns ./mlflow-artifacts
